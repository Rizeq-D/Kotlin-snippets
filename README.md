# Kotlin Snippets

Welcome to my Kotlin Snippets repository! Here, you'll find a collection of simple exercises and code snippets that I've learneed in Kotlin.

## About Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern programming language developed by JetBrains. It's known for its conciseness, safety, 
and interoperability with Java. This repository serves as a playground for me to experiment with Kotlin syntax and features.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the snippets in this repository. Each file contains a standalone Kotlin code snippet or a small exercise. 
You can view the code directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine to try out the snippets yourself.
